# Bull's Eye

This is my first iOS Project which I have created from SwiftUI with the help of [Raywenderlich Tutorials](http://raywenderlich.com/)

## Goal
The app's goal was simple to achieve. 
There's a slider that you need to slide to the right random number generated by the app by guessing the most accurate position possible.
If the guess was just missed by 1 then 50 bonus points are given and when the guess is accurate then 100 bonus points are awarded of-course including the points that was achieved by the slider itself.
